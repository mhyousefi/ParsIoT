# ParsIoT
An IoT-based project, Automatic Plant Watering System (APWS) is conducted by the group ParsIoT within the Fardak internship program at IoT Academy.
The system encompasses an Arduino UNO, an Arduino Nano, a Raspberry Pi 3, XBee modules to establish wireless connection among the mentioned boards as well as a number of sensors (e.g. DHT22, YL_69, and MQ-2) and actuators (a fan and a water pump).
APWS utilizes the server platform at thingtalk.ir and offers a native Andoid app to the user end.
